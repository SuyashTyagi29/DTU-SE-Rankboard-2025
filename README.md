# DTU Software Engineering Class of 2025 Rank Analyser
Felt quite bored and hence wanted to check where I stand in my branch, so built this basic web app that can help me in knowing so. 
Scraped all semester marksheets available on the [**DTU Examination**](https://exam.dtu.ac.in/result.htm) portal. 

Scraping was done using Python's pdfplumber library. Scraping had to be done separately for semesters 1-2, 3-6 and 7-8, because of different pdf structures.
